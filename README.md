# DSA Patterns

1.  **Two Pointers:** Primarily used with **Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings** (especially when sorted or needing in-place modification).
2.  **Sliding Window:** Primarily used with **Arrays, Strings** (for contiguous sub-sequences).
3.  **Fast & Slow Pointers (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare):** Primarily used with **Linked Lists** (for cycle detection, finding middle), also applicable to **Arrays** representing sequences with cycles.
4.  **Merge Intervals:** Primarily used with **Arrays of Intervals** (e.g., `[[start, end], ...]`).
5.  **Cyclic Sort:** Primarily used with **Arrays** (specifically arrays containing numbers within a defined range, often 1 to N or 0 to N-1).
6.  **In-place Reversal of a Linked List:** Exclusively used with **Linked Lists**.
7.  **Tree BFS (Level Order Traversal):** Primarily used with **Trees** and general **Graphs** (for level-by-level traversal). Uses a **Queue** as an auxiliary data structure.
8.  **Tree DFS (Depth First Traversal):** Primarily used with **Trees** and general **Graphs** (for exploring paths deeply). Uses **Recursion** or a **Stack** as an auxiliary data structure.
9.  **Two Heaps (Priority Queues):** Primarily used with **Heaps (Priority Queues)**, often used to process data from **Streams** or **Arrays**.
10. **Subsets / Backtracking:** Applicable to generating combinations/permutations from **Arrays, Lists, Strings**. The underlying structure is often a **Recursion Tree** implicitly.
11. **Modified Binary Search:** Primarily used with **Sorted Arrays**, or any data set where the search space can be effectively halved (e.g., finding a value in a rotated sorted array, or searching on an "answer space").
12. **Top 'K' Elements:** Primarily used with **Heaps (Priority Queues)**, and operates on **Arrays, Lists** as input.
13. **K-way Merge:** Primarily used with **Sorted Lists** or **Arrays of Sorted Lists**. Uses a **Min-Heap** as an auxiliary data structure.
14. **Topological Sort:** Exclusively used with **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**.
15. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** A technique that often involves **Arrays** (for memoization tables or tabulation), **Strings**, and **Grids/Matrices** for state representation.
16. **Greedy Algorithms:** A paradigm that applies to various problems. Can involve **Arrays, Lists, Graphs** (e.g., for minimum spanning trees, shortest paths in specific cases), or even just simple variables.
17. **Graph Traversal (General BFS/DFS):** Exclusively used with general **Graphs** (represented by Adjacency Lists or Adjacency Matrices).
18. **Trie (Prefix Tree):** A specialized **Tree-like data structure** specifically designed for storing and retrieving **Strings** based on prefixes.
